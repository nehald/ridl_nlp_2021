Background:
The ability to classify time series with a little/incomplete data is important
in a number time-sensitive military contexts including: satellite telemetry,
missile typing, and activity based intelligence (ABI).  In this sabbatical ETSC
techniques will be applied to Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) data which is
used to determine the type (and range) of foreign missile systems.  A cursory
exploration of AI/ML to MW event characterization has been conducted for
Project West Wing, but a significant gap in research and implementation of
early timeseries classification remains
